# Seinfeld Script Generator

This exercise was part of the [Udacity Deep Learning / ML nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101), and involved building a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) with LSTMs, and then training it up on the full Seinfeld script corpus in order to generate new scripts using seed words.
